I am an Assistant Professor in the Finance and Business Economics Department at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington and Carol Batchelder Finance Faculty Fellow.

My research interests span a variety of areas in corporate finance and private equity.

My current research leverages machine learning prediction methods to study inefficiencies in economic agents' decision making.

I am co-organizing the <a href="https://www.abfr-forum.org/">AI & Big Data in Finance Research Forum</a>.
