I am an Assistant Professor in the Finance and Business Economics Department at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington.

My research interests span a variety of areas in corporate finance. I have written papers on corporate governance, private equity and D&O insurance.

My current research leverages machine learning prediction methods to study economic agents' decision making.

I am joining the <a href="https://www.abfr-forum.org/">AI & Big Data in Finance Research Forum</a> as co-organizer starting in Dec. 2022.
