I am an Assistant Professor in the Finance and Business Economics Department at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington.

My research interests span a variety of areas in corporate finance. I have written papers on corporate governance (with an emphasis on boards of directors), private equity and D&O insurance.

Some of my current research revolves around the use of machine learning techniques as a tool to open up the black box of human decision making in economic contexts.
